# Welcome to my tech-space

**Hi there, welcome to my tech-sharing-space.**

## About me

A student majoring in **engineering**. But I do think what I really love is

**coding**, and that's what I am trying my best to.

## What for

* I am learning coding from the very begin and I find I always forget some important concepts and commit some simple mistakes when coding.

* By the way, I like suming some interesting points of knowledge but I do think the evernote and Onenote is hard to record and sharing my idea.

  **So I come here.** I will take this as my tech blog.
